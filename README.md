**Overview**
This project is a voice captioning and emotion detection model built using Python. It integrates Text-to-Speech (TTS) and speech recognition to interact with users through spoken words and classify emotions based on their speech.

**Features**
Speech Recognition: Listens to user input through the microphone and converts speech to text.
Text-to-Speech: Uses TTS to respond to users through voice, enhancing interactivity.
Emotion Detection: Analyzes the user's speech to detect emotions like joy, happiness, sadness, anger, or neutrality using sentiment analysis.

**Libraries**
pyttsx3: Python Text-to-Speech engine to enable speech output.
speech_recognition: Allows the program to recognize and capture speech from the microphone.
textblob: Used for sentiment analysis to detect emotion from the spoken text.

The system will prompt the user to speak.
The speech will be processed, and emotions like "happy," "sad," "angry," or "neutral" will be detected based on sentiment analysis.
The system will respond using TTS based on the emotion detected.
Example Interaction
User: "I'm feeling great today!"
System: "I'm glad to hear you're feeling happy!"
